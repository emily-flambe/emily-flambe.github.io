### what is this?

A website hosted on Github Pages ([emily-flambe.github.io](https://github.com/emily-flambe/emily-flambe.github.io)), generated with [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) using the theme [emily-zola-theme](https://github.com/kyoheiu/emily_zola_theme).

### who are you??

Flambe (she/her). I was born with a different name, and I'll probably die with yet another. Names are a fake idea.

My professional history is more-or-less documented on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycogsdill/).

### how do I reach you???

Oh! Don't make me blush.
