# https://emily-flambe.github.io/
This is a website where I write about... um. I'll get back to you about that...

# building & usage
I use [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) as a static site generator, and use Github Actions to push 
new builds to the `gh-pages` branch.

# themes
I use the [emily-zola-theme](https://github.com/kyoheiu/emily_zola_theme), because of course I do. (I did not create it.)

# contributing
It seems extremely unlikely that anyone would ever want to contribute to this unhinged abomination of a ""web site"", but anyway here are some issue examples from the repo I cribbed most of this code from ([vaporsoft](https://github.com/piedoom/vaporsoft)).

site issue example:
```
Title: Text is not justified on mobile
Description: [Description of issue] on Firefox 8 Windows 10
```

article mistake example:
```
Title: spelling error on Jan 3 2018
Description: "Creating a simple synthesizer VST plugin in Rust" has a mistake here [text to fix and replacement]
```

The same format is useful for suggestions.

Suggestion format:
```
Title: Add an explanation for DSP on Jan 3 2018
Description: "Creating a simple synthesizer VST plugin in Rust" should make sure the user knows that ...(etc.)...
```

See, doesn't it feel nice to feel like you _could_ contribute, if you wanted to? Hey, maybe you should, you know?

# best practices

# things to avoid

- probably any kind of radiation?
