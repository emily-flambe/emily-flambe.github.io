The 2020 South Carolina Democratic presidential primary is widely considered to have been a turning point in what was, as you certainly recall, a chaotic and uncertain primary season. Democrats were in disarray, though by the end of February, most podcasters and watercooler conversationalists were in agreement that the nominee would likely be Sanders or Warren, leaving what remained of the crowded field limping along on the fumes of rapidly fading hope.

On February 29, 2020, the morning of the South Carolina primary, a staffer for the Biden campaign headed into the office of campaign HQ in Philadelphia. To her dismay, as she reached to open the door to the front entrance, she noticed the lifeless corpse of a crow that had evidently flown into the glass. What had mere moments ago been a vibrant creature of the Earth was now an inert heap of disheveled feathers twitching in the icy wind.

This staffer was the director of reporting and analytics. Her task was to wield Data and Numbers to derive insights normally inaccessible to our limited human awareness. Yet her professional commitment to empiricism could not stave off the creeping tendrils of a superstitious foreboding. For what portend could possibly be more inauspicious than a dead bird, killed in an instant by its inability to see what was plainly obvious to everyone else: that its path forward was no path at all, but a solid and unforgiving barrier?

The outcome of that day was, of course, the exact opposite of what the bird portended. And this complete inversion of expectations, superstitious though they were, was (perhaps unsurprisingly) transmuted into a different superstition entirely. The crow’s death seemed a taunting echo of the dominant narratives about Biden - that he was just an old man tilting at windmills, a blind bird taking a flight of delusion that would certainly be his last. But the crow - or rather, the tale it seemed to tell - was wrong. And, for the first time, it seemed the podcasters and watercooler conversationalists might be wrong as well.

The crow was posthumously named Carol for its appearance on the morning of the South Carolina primary. A state named after a Caroline (actually King Charles I, but that's beside the point), and a Carol named after that state, all possessed a delicious circularity that mirrored the twisted divinity of the day’s events.

Thus began a venerated campaign tradition of throwing Carol at a window on the morning of each state's primary election. (Carol the Crow was represented in effigy by a crow plushie, though taxidermy was considered.) Super Tuesday followed shortly after the South Carolina primary and cemented Biden's place at the front of the pack, which persisted until his ultimate victory.

This tradition continued in the General Election as well, in which, like the primaries, different states began opening up early voting at different times. And on each occasion, all staff would receive a calendar invite for a 5-minute meeting, in which the staffer who first came across that hapless crow would gently toss Carol-in-effigy against a window. It was our way of remembering how far the team had come, particularly those who had worked on the primary and whose nerves had been hopelessly frayed long before the General Election even began. And it was our way of sharing a moment of reverence and hope while disguising the emotional weight of each anxious occasion in a ritual that was objectively absurd.

Campaigns attract people who are able to hold in their hearts both a commitment to rational inquiry and a dash (or a dollop) of magical thinking, the two dueling like serpents on the caduceus. After all, a campaign cannot hope to win without making intelligent use of the data it has available, but no campaign can ever hope to have enough data to predict the unpredictable, the October Surprises, the polling errors and modeling deficiencies that you know are mis-calibrating your expectations but which you are powerless to intercept.

Campaigns also attract people who cope with stress through humor, and there is very obvious humor in the act of ritually throwing a stuffed animal at a window.

Most staffers on the Biden campaign had mixed feelings about Biden as a candidate - we were pragmatists, by and large, who figured he was our best shot at defeating Trump. We were united in purpose, but not in a deeply held passion for our candidate. Carol the Crow thus attained a meaning and symbolism that transcended the man (and woman) we were trying to elect. The throwing of the Crow was more than a plushie doinking against a window in some faraway office - each doink was a fresh defiance of defeatism and despair.

And it told a tale of death, transfiguration, and resurrection - because while that crow's life ended on the steps of Biden HQ on February 29, 2020, Carol the Crow took on a life of her own, which continues in the hearts of all who bore witness.
