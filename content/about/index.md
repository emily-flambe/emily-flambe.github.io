### what is this? explain yourself

Oh I don't know. If I write things that are sufficiently non-terrible, they might end up here.

### about flambe (she/her)

I made a website once. It is this; you are reading it.

My professional history is more-or-less documented on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycogsdill/). My resume is hysterically out of date. I want to see how far I can get in life without updating it.

Can this be like a Tinder profile and I tell you to "just ask lol"?

_just ask lol_
