### what is this? explain yourself

Oh I don't know. If I write things that are sufficiently non-terrible, they might end up here.

### about flambe (she/her)

I made a website once. It is this; you are reading it. Hopefully that is one of the least exciting facts about my life.

The major plot beats of my professional history are more-or-less documented on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycogsdill/). I don't have a remotely up-to-date resume.

Can this be like a Tinder profile and I tell you to "just ask lol"?


...
_just ask lol_

Anyway, you can email me at emily flambe at googlemail.
