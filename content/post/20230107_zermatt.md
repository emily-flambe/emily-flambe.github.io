# Zermatt

I traveled to Zermatt for a quick ski trip in early January 2023. The town is everything I ever wanted in a Swiss ski destination, yet I found it moderately quirky to navigate (though ultimately not actually difficult).

I documented my experiences and some pro tips in the form of [this Google Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_v2DzwsOsAcBgXiTKrh_rrsbSYpgoEQUEbbrNScCG6E/edit?usp=sharing). The URL is publicly available and you are welcome to share it with anyone you wish, should you (like me) find the existing travel blogs and Reddit threads annoying to navigate.
