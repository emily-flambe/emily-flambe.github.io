# Lip Plumper

Lip balm is for normos. Use lip plumper instead.

It keeps your lips hydrated, and the "plumping" effect (can we please find another word though?) is achieved using an irritant, such as capsaicin, that will make your lips tingly and warm!

Why aren't more people talking about this??

# Wigs

You can wear a wig under your helmet! There's no rule against it!

Wigs are warm and they make you look like you put a lot of effort into your hair, which people think is a good thing for some reason.

Joke's on them, you're just wearing a sexy hair hat!

# Get really good at skiing

Alternatively: drink hot cider and wait for your friends. That sounds nice.
