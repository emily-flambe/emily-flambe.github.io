### what is this?

A website hosted on Github Pages ([emily-flambe.github.io](https://github.com/emily-flambe/emily-flambe.github.io)), generated using the [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) static site generator with the theme [emily-zola-theme](https://github.com/kyoheiu/emily_zola_theme).

### who are you??

Flambe (she/her). I was born with a different name, and I'll probably die with yet another one. Names are a fake idea anyway.

My professional history is more-or-less documented on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilycogsdill/). My resume is hysterically out of date. I want to see how far I can get in life without updating it.

Can this be like a Tinder profile and I tell you to "just ask lol"?

_just ask lol_

### contact???
