In 2019 I hiked 2000 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail. Along the way, I maintained a blog with daily posts that were generally poorly-written and a tad unhinged.

I paid someone a few bucks to migrate the whole thing to [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QRHPQf7KDRlDLnUlxozcww0CU8tKC1HWdsqTrIZilo/edit?usp=sharing).
